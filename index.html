        I design software for a living - and my wife is a Graphic Designer. Our cat is just a cat, but she does it really well. I've been a designer since 2007 and worked at multiple companies and startups, as well as starting a few of my own small ventures that are all since gone.

        Right now I work at Oaknorth AI, one of the most valuable fintech startups in the world.
